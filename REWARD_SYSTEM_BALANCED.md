## üéÆ BALANCING PHILOSOPHY

### Why These Changes?
1. **Meaningful Progression**: Each resource now requires effort to obtain
2. **Strategic Choices**: Players must choose which activities to prioritize
3. **Long-term Engagement**: Tree growth takes time and dedication
4. **Reward Satisfaction**: Completing activities feels more rewarding
5. **Balanced Difficulty**: Not too easy, not too hard

### Resource Scarcity
- **Water & Sunlight**: Most common, needed for early stages
- **Nutrients**: Moderate scarcity, needed for mid stages
- **Fertilizer**: Rare, needed for advanced stages
- **Love**: Very rare, needed for final stages

This rebalanced system ensures that every activity completion feels meaningful and that tree growth requires genuine effort and strategic planning! üå±‚ú®
